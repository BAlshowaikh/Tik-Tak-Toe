# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to a modern and responsive web-based version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game! This project showcases a clean and intuitive user interface built with core web technologies.

## ✨ Features

- **Two-Player Gameplay**: A classic head-to-head game of X's and O's.
- **Responsive Design**: The game board and interface adapt perfectly to any screen size, from desktop to mobile.
- **Visual Turn Indicators**: Clearly shows which player's turn it is with dynamic, color-coded indicators.
- **Win & Draw Detection**: Automatically detects and announces when a player has won or if the game has ended in a draw.
- **Game Status Overlay**: A pop-up overlay displays the result of the game, providing a clear and engaging user experience.
- **Easy Restart**: A dedicated restart button allows for quick and easy new games.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

-   **HTML**: Provides the semantic structure of the game board and interface.
-   **CSS**: Styles the game with a modern, "Pixelify Sans" theme and handles the responsive layout using **viewport units (`vmin`)**.
-   **JavaScript**: Manages all game logic, including player turns, state management, win condition checks, and user interaction.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  Players take turns clicking on any of the empty cells.
3.  The game alternates between Player X and Player O.
4.  The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!
5.  If all cells are filled and no one has won, the game is a draw.
6.  Click the restart button at any time to start a new game.
